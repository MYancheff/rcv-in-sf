Potential Objectives 
1. Can you wrangle the data? Get this out on the repo for people to look at
  -Early parsing completed. 
  -Next steps, maybe new variables including data relating to Condorcet winners   
   
a. Can you reproduce the election results? Consider the difference in threshold reporting between Alameda county and SF county.
  -Shiny app for sliding totals over time

2. Visualize. Different levels of complexity by area? income? which city you're in? Number of candidates? campaign spending?
  -Maybe map visualizations? Sliders would be cool here, but perhaps a little ambitious  


Things to consider: what predicts future runs by candidates? Their initial amount of votes? Their initial ranking? Their final ranking? Focused support among one group or area?
  -We're going to need outside research here. 

See if Condorcet winner matches the RCV winner. Other types of elections also?
-See the paper (posted on 4/7) in the Slack thread
