## Ranked Choice Voting: San Francisco

**Project Abstract**

FairVote is a nonpartisan organization with the goal of improving ‘the democratic process in America.’ One of their major directives is the advocacy for ranked choice voting. Our project is interested in assisting one of their research fellows, Theodore Landsman, with his project about the effects of ranked choice voting (RCV). To do so, we will looked at  San Francisco Bay Area municipalities that have ballot image data available on RCV. The first process we have completed is to wrangle and tidy the raw ballot image data from San Francisco County's November 8th, 2016 election for District Supervisors for Districts 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11 by using a master look up file to parse out voter information. Each row of the ballot image contained information such as the voter's precinct and the voter's ranking of the candidates for the race. We then produced visualizations displaying how several voter variables may impact ranked choice voting.
